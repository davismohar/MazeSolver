# MazeSolver
This program will provide solutions to black and white maze images.
There are some requirements for the images- They must be rectangular, the entrance must be at the top
with the exit at the bottom, and there must be a solution.


This was inspired by a video on Computerphile on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI.
